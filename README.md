Module #14

***Overview of the analysis:*** The purpose of the analysis was to use public Citi Bike rider data for a period of time in 2019. This data including things like starting & ending locations, rides by gender, ride duration & weekday patterns of riders. This data was robust and provided plenty of opportunities for analysis.

***Results:*** [Citi Bike Challenge Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrick.dobry/viz/Deliverable3Challenge/CitiBikeChallengeStory?publish=yes)

Our story starts out with Checkout times by duration. This shows the number of bikes and trip duration after we cleaned the data in python. Then we segment it by genders. There is male, female & unknown categories for that measure. To reinforce our point about peak hours, we show the stoptime heat mapshowing that before and after work hours is the most utilized time for our bikeshare proposal. Then, we show that male are more likely to use thes bikes especially during those hours. Finally, subscribers are our best customers and have the strongest ridership. We also were able to show bike utilization & bike repairs rendered as cool visualizations. 

***Summary:*** To summarize, males were much more active riders than females and there are clear dropoffs in ridership during the early morning hours. Another analysis we would have like to provide is how lit up the streets were at starting & ending destinations by other publically available data. This would help ensure rider safety. This could have been achieved by using a streets view with the Mapbox software underlying Tableau. We would also like to know the price per ride to implement surge pricing to more efficiently allocate the bikes during rush hours. 

For this module we were tasked with measuring Citi Bike Sharing usage.
