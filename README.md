Module #14

***Overview of the analysis:*** The purpose of the analysis was to use public Citi Bike rider data for a period of time in 2019. This data including things like starting & ending locations, rides by gender, ride duration & weekday patterns of riders. This data was robust and provided plenty of opportunities for analysis.

***Results:*** Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

***Summary:*** To summarize, males were much more active riders than females and there are clear dropoffs in ridership during the early morning hours. Another analysis we would have like to provide is how lit up the streets were at starting & ending destinations by other publically available data. This would help ensure rider safety. We would also like to know the price per ride to implement surge pricing to more efficiently allocate the bikes during rush hours. 

For this module we were tasked with measuring Citi Bike Sharing usage.
